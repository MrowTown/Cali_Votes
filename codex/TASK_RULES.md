# Codex Rules (non-negotiable)

Codex must:
1) Work only on a branch named `codex/<ticket-slug>`
2) Create ONE PR per task
3) NOT create new files unless the ticket explicitly lists them
4) NOT rename pages without updating docs/HANDOFF.md
5) Include a PR checklist:
   - What changed
   - How to test locally
   - How to verify in production

Default scope:
- Frontend changes live in /frontend only.
- Apps Script changes only when explicitly requested.
